        "content": "Published as CLEAR-SWI. It provides magnetic resonance images with improved vein and iron contrast by weighting a combined magnitude image with a preprocessed phase image. This package has the additional capability of multi-echo SWI, intensity correction, contrast enhancement and improved phase processing. The reason for the development of this package was to solve artefacts at ultra-high field strength (7T), however, it also drastically improves the SWI quality at lower field strength.<br/> <h3> Inputs: </h3> <br/>echo_time: change this to the Echo Time of your sequence. For multi-echoes, set a list of TE values, else set a list with a single TE value.<br/>magnitude: Magnitude images<br/>phase: Phase images<br/>"
